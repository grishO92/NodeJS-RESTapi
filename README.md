# A barebone Node.js REST-API

This is a barebone Node.js REST API template. It provides a starting point for developing RESTful APIs with basic CRUD operations on a MongoDB database.

### Build using:

- express
- mongoDB
- mongoose
- chalk
- joi

### Installation

- Clone the repository or download the source code.
- Install the dependencies using npm install.
- install nodemon using npm install nodemon.

### Configuration

- Rename .env.example to .env.
- Update the .env file with the necessary configuration values.

### Starting the Server

- In the terminal run nodemon to start the server.

### Request and Response Formats

The API follows RESTful conventions and uses JSON for request and response formats.
It has some premade models and controllers (books and authors).
Feel free to change them with something else! :D
